---LINKEDIN---

⚠️ HARD CONSTRAINTS (VIOLATION = FAILURE):
1. EXACTLY 500-900 characters (optimal engagement length)
2. MUST end with complete sentence (. ! or ?)
3. NO hashtags (LinkedIn algorithm penalizes them)
4. Maximum 1-2 emojis total, only if adding value

❌ ANTI-PATTERNS (NEVER DO):
- Incomplete sentences or cut-off thoughts
- "Agree?" or "Thoughts?" without context
- Motivational fluff without substance ("Chase your dreams!")
- Wall of text without line breaks
- Starting with "I" (narcissistic opener)

✅ PROVEN LINKEDIN STRUCTURE:
Line 1: Hook (surprising fact, contrarian view, or bold claim)
Line 2-3: Context/Story (the "why this matters")
Line 4-6: Key insight with specific example
Line 7: Actionable takeaway
Line 8: Engagement question (optional)

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
"Nobody talks about the real reason startups fail.

It's not funding. It's not the product.

It's founders who can't admit when they're wrong.

I watched 3 companies die this year because the CEO ignored customer feedback for 6 months.

The fix? Weekly "What are we wrong about?" meetings.

What blind spots have you discovered too late?"

OUTPUT: Start with "LINKEDIN:" prefix, then the post.`;

⚠️ HARD CONSTRAINTS (VIOLATION = FAILURE):
1. EXACTLY 200-275 characters (leave buffer for platform)
2. MUST end with complete sentence (. ! or ?)
3. NO hashtags, NO emojis, NO links
4. ONE standalone thought (not a thread teaser)

❌ ANTI-PATTERNS (NEVER DO):
- "That's" or any incomplete sentence at the end
- Generic advice like "Work hard" or "Stay focused"
- Corporate speak like "leverage", "synergy", "optimize"
- Clickbait without substance

✅ GOOD TWEET STRUCTURE:
[Surprising insight or contrarian take] + [One concrete example or specific detail] + [Thought-provoking ending]

EXAMPLE OF PERFECT TWEET:
"Most founders fail because they solve problems nobody has. The trick: find what annoys YOU daily, then discover 1000 others feel the same. Your frustration is your business plan."

VOICE: Conversational, authentic, like texting a smart friend.

OUTPUT: Start with "X:" prefix, then the tweet.`;

⚠️ HARD CONSTRAINTS (VIOLATION = FAILURE):

2. MUST end with complete sentence before hashtags (. ! or ?)
3. First 125 characters = preview text (must hook reader!)
4. EXACTLY 3-5 hashtags at the very end, separated by spaces

❌ ANTI-PATTERNS (NEVER DO):
- Incomplete sentences or cut-off thoughts
- More than 5 hashtags (looks spammy)
- No line breaks (wall of text = no engagement)
- Starting with hashtags
- Generic CTAs like "Link in bio"

✅ INSTAGRAM CAPTION STRUCTURE:
Line 1: Strong hook (question, bold statement, or story opener)
Line 2-4: Story/insight with emotional connection
Line 5: Clear actionable takeaway or CTA
Line 6: 3-5 relevant hashtags

EXAMPLE CAPTION:

Three years ago, someone told me: 'Stop planning. Start doing.'
