# Subscription Performance Fix

## Problem
- Subscription check was timing out after 10 seconds even though the query completed successfully in ~170ms
- This was due to a JavaScript closure bug where the timeout couldn't see that loading was already set to false

## Solution
1. Used `useRef` to properly manage the timeout reference
2. Clear the timeout explicitly when the subscription check completes
3. Added database indexes for faster queries:
   - `idx_subscriptions_user_id_created_at` on (user_id, created_at DESC)
   - `idx_subscriptions_user_id_status` on (user_id, status) WHERE status = 'active'

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/UpgradeButton.tsx` - Added useRef for timeout management

## Monitoring
Added detailed console logging to track performance:
- `[Subscription Check] Starting...`
- `[Subscription Check] Session fetched in X ms`
- `[Subscription Check] Query completed in X ms`
- `[Subscription Check] Timeout cleared`

This helps identify bottlenecks in the subscription check flow.
